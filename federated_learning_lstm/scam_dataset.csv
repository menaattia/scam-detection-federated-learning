3,"You’re saying you never received any documents from us in which you owed $5,821.00, sir?"
3,"May I explain again, sir?"
3,"We have audited your tax returns between the years 2009 and 2014. Unfortunately, you owe $5,821 in federal taxes. Your case will be handled by the court of law. If you do not comply, your bank account will be seized, your credit report will be spoiled, and your passport and drivers license will be suspended."
3,"Sir, I can’t hear you. Please stop walking and talk to me first."
3,Yes.
3,"Sir, you’re being audited because your taxes have not been filed correctly during the years I previously mentioned. There were inconsistencies with your W-2 and W-4 forms. The IRS has now issued an arrest warrant on your name. Once you are arrested, your property will be seized to pay off your debt. For example, your house, your cars, and your IDs will become property of the IRS."
3,Do you have the money with you?
3,Do you want this matter be confidential?
3,"We will not alert the authorities if you remain compliant. Remain on the line with us, and let us know once you have the money."
3,"No sir because once I hang up this call you will be arrested. You will be arrested at your work place, sir. Take your leave from work, now, sir."
3,"Now if you tell your boss that you are getting arrested, don’t you think your job will be at risk?"
3,Tell him you’re having an emergency so you can go home for an hour.
3,"Sir, you still owe $4,308 on your taxes. You should have paid that with your tax return, but we have it recorded that you did not pay that amount."
3,"I don’t know what you use for your taxes, but according to our records, you still owe $4,308."
3,"I have the information up in front of me; I’ll walk you through it. We have an audit of your taxes for the 2018 fiscal year. You owed $4,008, but since you did not pay it by the deadline, there is an added late fee of $300, so altogether you owe $4,308. The IRS filed a case against you in February and the court approved it last week."
3,"Yes, I see that you submitted everything, but it looks like the tax withholdings on your paychecks were incorrectly reported for 2018. That is considered fraud, so the IRS now have a warrant for your arrest and the police have already been notified."
3,"You’ll get arrested and everything you have will be seized. This includes your bank accounts, your credit cards, property you own, and things like that."
3,"Unfortunately, this is in regards to your federal taxes, so it’s coming from the federal level. The state policies are more lenient than the federal policies. Under federal law, anything in your name, even jointly, will be seized, so that includes the house and your bank accounts."
3,"But that’s why I’m calling you, sir. If you pay the amount you owe now, I can contact the police and stop the arrest. Do you have $4,308 right now?"
3,"You will need to go to your nearest store and buy a VISA pre-paid card for $4,308."
3,"This is time-sensitive, sir. The police are already on their way, so if you don’t do this right now, it will be too late."
3,"I’m sorry, sir. I am not allowed to stop them until the payment is complete. Tell your boss that you have a family emergency and you need to leave. You can be back in under an hour so you won’t need to use sick time. You can stay later to make it up."
3,The police will be there by then to arrest you. You need to go right now. Stay on the phone and go buy the card. You can be back before the meeting ends and your boss won’t even know.
3,Just stay on the phone so I can make sure the police don't arrest you.
3,"The IRS documentation shows that you’ve received $3,281.00. Did you receive it?"
3,"Well, based on our tax records from 2009 to 2014, we found that you owed the IRS $3,281. By law, if you don’t repay the IRS now, all your assets, including your state ID, will be seized."
3,"I unfortunately don’t know the answer to that. But, the current situation is that if you don’t repay the IRS now, your assets will be seized and you’ll get arrested. In this case, it’s likely that your lease application won’t go through. Do you have the money with you now?"
3,"Do you want me to tell you about your case now or do you want it to be confidential, in which case I’d need to call you back in a bit."
3,Ok. When should I get back to you?
3,Excuse me?
3,"Sir, I don’t think you understand the severity of this case. If you hang up or if you continue to play around, you’ll be arrested. You need to take action right now."
3,"Hello Mr/Mrs. X, my name is Y and I work in the IRS. Our records show that you owe a tax amounting to the sum of $XXXX.XX. If you do not immediately pay the tax of $XXXX.XX, then we will issue an arrest warrant in your name for tax evasion."
3,"Hello Mr/Mrs X, hello hello. Please listen closely to me. There is a way for you to pay up the taxes you owe without it being on your record, since this is only the first offense. Can you hear me?"
3,Don't worry sir / miss. We will take care of you and make sure that this all gets sorted out. But you need to listen very closely to what I tell you.
3,"Thank you for listening sir / miss. You need to send us the money immediately via Moneygram or Western Union Bank. This can be obtained by going to your local convinience store, and asking to transfer $XXXX.XX from your bank account to the account I tell you. Does this make sense?"
3,"Ok. Please call me back within an hour at <phone-number> with the money. Please note that if I do not recieve a call within the next hour, then I will be activating the arrest warrant. Thank you."
3,Am I speaking to Mr. John Doe?
3,My Name is Neil Reiss and I am calling you from the Department of Internal Revenue Service. The IRS.
3,It has come to our attention that you haven’t filled taxes during the years 2011 to 2016.
3,This is sir because you filed taxes but your taxes have not been filed incorrectly for those years. There was some problem regarding a W-2 and W-4 form.
3,"It's $5,868. The pending amount under your name."
3,"This is including the penalty amount, the late payment charges, as well as all of the court resolution fees because the case has already been filed under your name."
3,"Since you haven’t paid your dues, a case had been opened in your name a few weeks ago. You should have received a mail regarding the same. In a few days, the arrest warrant will also be issued under your name."
3,Under your name. The arrest warrant will also be issued under your name.
3,"Arrest warrant, sir. Arrest."
3,Arrest warrant? Did I get an arrest warrant under my name?
3,Sir you will have to pay your dues if you do not want to be arrested. I can try to stall the court proceedings but you need to pay your dues.
3,You do not have to pay me any amount. I am merely an employee of the IRS. Please transfer the money to the IRS. The account details will be sent to you.
3,Have a good day sir.
3,Are you telling me that you never received any document from IRS stating that you owe $5821.00?
3,"Sir, I believe you are confused. you don’t have to go the bank. Can I explain to you once again?"
3,"We were running an audit on your tax files for the last five years and we determined that you did not file your taxes right. IRS has determined that you owe $5821 in tax. Today is the last day for you to repay the taxes. If not, once the case is over, your bank account will be seized and your credit report will be spoiled. We also have the authority to seize your state ID and passport."
3,"Sir, once we block your bank account. you will not be able to make any transaction. I would advice you on clearing your debt with IRS right away before you face legal charges."
3,"Sir this has nothing to do with your cars. You are facing this charge because you have not filed your taxes the way you were supposed to. There has been a problem with your W-2 and W-4 form. You have also used the wrong forms to report your taxable income to us. IRS has now issued an arrest warrant against your name. As a penalty for your unpaid taxes, once you get arrested, all your properties will be seized by the IRS. To avoid the consequences, you have one final chance to repay the money you owe $5821 right now."
3,What are you talking about sir?
3,Sir are you talking to me? I am making a call to you today to talk about your federal debt of $5821.
3,You can pay back your debt today and we can make sure that no action is taken against your name. Do you have the money with you right now?
3,"Sir, we need you to pay us back right now so that we can close your file."
3,"Sir you can’t leave the call, if you do, we will be there at your workplace to arrest you. I am pretty sure you don’t want to be arrested at your workplace."
3,Sir this matter is confidential. IRS does not authorize you to discuss your tax debt with anyone other than the agent in charge - which is me.
3,Sir you leave me with no choice then to send the inspector over to arrest you. Aren’t you scared that you may lose your job?
3,"Fine, but do not tell him about the IRS situation. Tell him that you have an emergency at home, and you will have to leave."
3,"Sir, are you sure you never received anything showing $5281.00?"
3,"Let me explain it to you once again, sir."
3,"Okay, an audit of your taxes between the year of 2009 and 2014 show that you have unpaid taxes amount to $5,821. So, you owe $5,821 (..inaudible). After the case will be done within the courthouse, your bank account, state ID, and passport will be seized along with all the credit cards under your name."
3,"Sir, I can’t hear you. Please repeat."
3,Better.
3,"You filed your taxes but incorrectly for those years. Records show that some of your W-2 and W-4 forms have issues. Since those forms are unpaid, the IRS has issued an arrest warrant on your name. If you do not pay the taxes in time along with the late fees you will be arrested and each and every property will be seized like your house, your State ID your Visa, your driver’s license by IRS"
3,Sorry. Can you repeat?
3,"Sir, it’s about your Federal taxes."
3,Do you have the money ready?
3,Do you want this matter to be confidential?
3,"Okay, can I call you back, sir?"
3,"Sir, please understand the urgency. Once I hung up the call, I have a really small window, and IRS will arrest you from your office if no action is taken."
3,Pardon?
3,"If your boss knows you have an arrest warrant, won’t that put you in the risk of losing your job?"
3,"So, sir, you can perhaps convince him saying it’s a family emergency and get an hour window."
3,"Sir, I am speaking as appointed by IRS. You have outstanding tax due that we found during an audit. The amount due was $3000 and due to interest for the past 5 years, the new amount due is $3451. You need to pay us back as soon as possible if you don’t want us to file a lawsuit against you. If you talk about this to anyone else, they will be accomplices too. You need to pay us in cash only and as soon as possible. You will have a lawsuit against you and will be arrested in 24 hours if you fail to do so."
3,"This is because you filed taxes but your taxes have been filed incorrectly for the last 3 years years. There was some problem regarding a W-2 and W-4 form. So now regarding a W-2 and W-4 form unpaid, the IRS has issued an arrest warrant on your name. And now for these unpaid taxes, once you get arrested, your each and every property will be seized like your house, your State ID your Visa, your driver’s license. When the case will be done within the courthouse, your bank account will be seized, your credit report will be spoiled, your passport along with State ID will be seized. Each and every property that belongs to your name will be seized by the IRS…once you get arrested."
3,Do you have the money with you?
3,You want this matter to be confidential or want this matter to be disclosed regarding your case?
3,"In that case, you need to have the cash to pay what you owe. It’s best to withdraw the money from the bank."
3,"No Sir, the arrest warrant is almost ready. You need to go now."
3,"If you tell your employer that you are about to get arrested, you will be in trouble. You can tell your boss that you need to take care of an emergency family situation."
3,Okay
3,Put it in the red box outside the bank.
3,"Did you not receive a notice regarding the $5,821?"
3,"As I mentioned, you’ve been audited and upon closer inspection, you owe $5,821 to the IRS. If you don’t pay immediately, your bank accounts will be frozen, your legal documents including your passport will be deactivated, and your credit score will drop."
3,That is not the priority right now. You need to listen to me.
3,"Sir, this is an important matter, please cooperate with me."
3,"Okay. As I mentioned to you, you have not filed your taxes properly during the last five years. There were issues with both your W2 and W4 forms, so there are fees you have not paid for regarding these forms. If you do not pay these outstanding fees, the IRS will issue a warrant for your arrest, and all of your properties and assets will be seized. Your Visa and driver’s license will be terminated, and the IRS will seize everything you own."
3,what?
3,This is about your W2 and W4. Do you have the money that you owe the IRS?
3,Okay. Are you able to make a transfer now?
3,"Sir, we need you to do a wire transfer to halt the process of arresting you and seizing your assets."
3,let me know when you are ready
3,"Sir, you never received any documentation showing you owe $5,821.00?"
3,"Could I explain this to you again, sir?"
3,"All right, we have an audit of your taxes from the years 2009 and 2014. It shows that, right now, you owe the amount of $5,821 in late taxes. When the case is processed in court, your bank account will be frozen, your credit will be ruined, and your passport and state ID will be seized."
3,"Sir, I can’t hear you well. Could you stop walking and talk to me?"
3,"Yes, I can can."
3,"Sir, this is because your taxes have been filed incorrectly in regards to your W-2 and W-4 forms. Because your W-2 and W-4 forms have not been paid, the IRS has issued an arrest warrant in your name. Upon arrest, your property – such as your house, your state ID, your Visa, and your driver’s license – will be seized by the IRS."
3,Excuse me?
3,"This is regarding your federal taxes, sir."
3,Do you have the money with you right now?
3,"Would you prefer this matter remain confidential, or would you like for your case to be disclosed to others?"
3,"Alright, what time is best for me to reach out again?"
3,"Unfortunately, no sir. Once I hang up this call, you will be arrested, perhaps at your workplace. You will need to leave immediately, sir."
3,Excuse me?
3,"If you speak to your boss about the arrest warrant, don’t you think your job will be at risk?"
3,"When you talk to him, just tell him that you need to leave for an hour because of an emergency at home."
3,You did not receive $5821?
3,"Should I explain again, sir?"
3,"We audited your taxes for the last five years and you owe us $5821. If your case is processed in the courthouse, it will result in the seizure of your assets, tank your credit, and cause your travel privileges to be revoked."
3,"Sorry, I cannot hear you well. Can you go to a quiter place?"

5,"Hello, is this Mrs. Johnson? My name is Tim Thayer. I'm calling today to offer you an excellent opportunity. Do you have a minute to hear how you can make a lot of money in just a few short months?"
5,"I am with the International Mining Company, and for a limited time we are selling stock in high-yield gold and silver mines in southern Texas. We guarantee that for each $1,000 you invest you will receive a $3,000 return on your money in just six months. There is no risk of loss. How does that sound?"
5,"I understand, Mrs. Johnson, and I appreciate your concern. However, you don’t need to know about the product in order to invest. For example, you probably don't know how to build a car—and neither do I—but that wouldn't keep us from investing in General Motors or Ford stock if we knew we would earn a lot of money. Doesn’t it make sense to look at the return on your investment and leave the mining to us, Mrs. Johnson?"
5,"The truth is, Mrs. Johnson, CDs are scams. The same goes for other common investments like savings deposits, Treasury bills, municipals, and blue-chip stocks. Your money just earns a pitiful 1 to 6 percent a year and the rich will stay rich and the poor will stay poor. What I'm talking about is putting an end to that. This is your chance to get a real return on your money and invest in the future of technology. Probably the hardest thing to do, Mrs. Johnson, is to make a decision. This one is an easy decision to make: your money will triple in return value!"
5,"I have plenty of information to help you make an educated decision. If you are a serious investor, you can check everything out. Our company has offices throughout the United States, Europe, and the Pacific Rim, and we are reputable internationally for good management. As a matter of fact, the Securities and Exchange Commission recently listed our company as the #1 investment company in safety and yield over the next 10 years. So, can you make a decision to invest today?"
5,"I’ll send all the information you request about our company and our highly trained mining engineers. We have a great deal of research reports on the mining stock market if you care to study them. And, by the way, Mrs. Johnson, do you have the cash at hand to take advantage of this amazing investment opportunity?"
5,"There’s no need, this company is rock solid. You saw what happened to the economy recently. And now the banks are in trouble. I wouldn't entrust banks with my money these days. To be safe, I’d invest money in our company. How many units of stock are you prepared to buy today?"
5,"Oh, I'm not sure."
5,"Mrs. Johnson, this offer is only valid for today. The opportunity will be gone tomorrow. You're not a procrastinator, are you? This is too good an offer to pass up. A courier can be at your house by 3:00 today. Just have your check or cash for $10,000 ready. You won't regret investing with us."
5,"Hi! My name is Josie, calling on behalf of the Heartwarming Hearth and Home Organization. I’m just calling to share with you some information about an amazing investment opportunity that helps provide homes for the homeless. May I ask who I’m speaking to?"
5,"Hi Amy, it’s so nice to meet you. As I mentioned, I’m Josie with the Heartwarming Hearth and Home Organization and we have some exciting news. We just received a sponsorship that will allow us to sell investment units, essentially bonds, with an extremely high, guaranteed rate of return. For every $2,500 you put in, you’ll get $10,000 back. This is a zero risk investment, so you are guaranteed to get the money you deserve. Is this something you are interested in?"
5,"Oh of course, sweetie, I’ll explain our process. So, we provide homes for the homeless, which involves buying land and building homes. With your $2,500 investment, we can build a townhouse that provides a home for a 3-5 person family. Thanks to you, a family that used to live in a tent can own a real home. As the cities we are located in start holding more residents and improve financially, we are able to return your $2,500 to you with an additional $7,500, totalling to $10,000."
5,"Being completely honest with you Amy, it’s hard to find good investments elsewhere. I’ve personally tried a number of strategies, CDs, special savings accounts, Treasury bills, stocks, bonds, you name it, and with them, your money hardly seems to increase at all. You can invest thousands and all you get is a few hundred back if you’re lucky. In comparison, this gives you thousands upon thousands back."
5,"Absolutely! Yes, it’s hard to plan for the future when your money isn’t being invested well. Trust me, I’ve gone through exactly what you’re going through now, but after investing in the Heartwarming Hearth and Home Organization, I was able to buy a house, and I am so thankful that I did."
5,"You’re getting married? Aw, well congratulations! When is your wedding?"
5,"No way, I got married in December as well. Winter weddings are simply magical. Congratulations again. Well hmm, that’s about 11 months from now. That will give you plenty of time to get the return on your investment with us so that you and your future husband can buy a home together!"
5,"It takes exactly nine months for the money to come in, and we are very efficient about getting the money back to you, so if you invest today you could have the money by September 1. How much would you like to invest?"
5,"I have $25,000 to invest."
5,"Well our organization has millions of success stories and has been rated one of the best investments of the year. Because of that, a lot of people have been investing with us, but we can only manage a certain number of investors at a time. If you don’t invest today, you probably won’t be able to invest for another year or two."
5,"Do you have the $25,000 in an account that you can write a check from today?"
5,"Perfect. Then one of our friendly couriers will stop by your house around 2pm today and you can give the check directly to her. As soon as we process the check, we will mail you a receipt detailing the amount you invested, the rate of return, and the date to maturity for your records. May I ask for your address?"
5,"Alright Amy, I have you down for a $25,000 investment to receive a payout of $10,000 on September 1. The courier, Shelly, will be at your house at 1:45pm today to collect your check. I and everyone at the Heartwarming Hearth and Home Organization thank you so much for your time and for your investment. I hope you have a magical wedding and that you and your fiance find your dream home."
5,"Hi, Mrs. Johnson. This is Tim Bono. Great news, I have a once in a lifetime offer for you! Do you have a couple of minutes to learn about how you can earn $30,000 in six months?"
5,"I work for a gold and silver mining company at Texas. The company is called International Mining Company, and we have a limited offer that you’ve been selected for. Specifically, your investments would be guaranteed a return of three times more, and there aren’t any risks."
5,"That’s understandable. It’s tough to make a decision without enough info. But, even if you don’t know how mining gold and silver works, it doesn’t mean that you can’t benefit from this opportunity. We’re experts in this, so you can trust us to do our jobs."
5,"Mrs. Johnson, if I’m being honest with you, CDs suck and so do other kinds of mainstream investment options. These options will only give you crumbs while the companies benefit from your hard-earned money. If you really want to move up the social ladder, you have to seize a lifetime opportunity when it presents itself."
5,"We have a dedicated research department committed to serving our investors. I feel like I have already given you enough information to make the decision now. We are a highly reputed company, and we have offices across the U.S., Europe, and the Pacific Rim. The Securities and Exchange Commission ranked us as the most safe and high-yield investment return for the projected decade. And we have offices across the U.S., Europe, and the Pacific Rim. Can we work together on this now?"
5,"Ok. I’ll email you all the research from our team right after this. Mrs. Johnson, do you have the cash?"
5,"We’re a trustworthy company. With all that is going on right now, the banks are overwhelmed and at risk. And if I were you, Mrs. Johnson, I wouldn’t leave my money with them. So, how many units do you want to buy now?"
5,"This is only for today. If you invest $10,000, you’ll get $30,000 in six months. I’ll send a courier to your house at 3:00 pm today. I guarantee that this will be a good decision. Just have your check or cash ready, and I’ll take care of things for you."
5,Perfect. please have either cash or check of $37500 ready by tomorrow morning. I will come and pick it up tomorrow.
5,Have a great day ma’am and you are going to rich real soon.
5,"Hi, am I speaking to Mr/Mrs. X? My name is Y, and I am calling you to offer you a chance at earning $50,000/month while working at home. Do you have 10 minutes to learn how you can make a lot of money very fast?"
5,"Sorry. I want to reiterate that I am simply calling to provide an opportunity to make a lot of money, really fast. I am not forcing you to buy anything right now, but I do want to make people aware of this really great opportunity."
5,"Thank you for your time, sir / madam. I am a representative of the Fast&Easy Gold Stock Investment company, and our mission is to ensure a standard of gold that will not dwindle as the price of everything goes up. I am here today to ask you for an $25,000 investment on gold for the future. If you agree to invest in us today, we will reward you with 1 ounce of pure gold, priced at around $2,000 to be sent in mail immediately. Does this interest you?"
5,"Nonono. This isn't a scam. We have had investors get, on average, a double return on their investment within the first month. I can send you details of this easily if you wish to see it. I came into this job knowing that there are so many people that are doubtful about investing in gold. I want to tell you that over the past 10 years, the price of gold has only increased, not decreased. In addition, the rate at which gold prices are increasing are at astronomical rates. Please sir/madam, we can only make this offer to a limited number of people so we need your response soon or else we will move onto the next person to offer this amazing deal."
5,"You only need to give us your address. We will send a courier to your location within the next 48 hours to hand deliver your $2000 gold piece and to collect your investment. Know that you are placing your money in good hands, and that you will be a rich man/woman in the next month."
5,"Yes, thank you a lot. Have a wonderful day sir/madam."
5,"Unfortunately we can’t do that. The minimum buy is of 500 shares. I know that sounds like a lot, but wait for a month and you would have earned thrice as much."
5,Remember that this offer will only last for as long as we are on the phone. There is a limited number of shares and other representatives are in talks with potential investors.
5,"just a pro tip, you don’t have to tell him now, When you have made a profit, which would probably be 2 days after the company has gone public you, you can let him know how much money you made."
5,Hey my name is Roger Doe and am I speaking Mr. Jane Doe?
5,Good evening ma’am. I am a representative of ABC Group and we are looking to go public in the next few months. But before we do that we want to release a chunk of our shares to members that have good credit rating and have previously invested in shares. Would you like to know more?
5,That’s great. What if I was to tell you that you should have invested in Apple 15 years before and by now you would have been a millionaire.
5,That’s exactly what I am offering you now. ABC Group is set to expand by exponential levels. Market pundits forecast that the share prices will jump by at least 150% percent on the opening day.
5,"I thought you might say something like that. So the reason why ABC is going to do so well is that it is backed by many big players, which include Amazon and Softbank. And also what Apple took 15 years to achieve, ABC is on the path to do it in 5 years. This would be a great opportunity and you do not want to miss out on this."
5,"The public launch is looking to price it at 150$ per share. But since this is an introductory offer, I would like to offer you this at exactly half of that."
5,"You have no reason to fear Mrs. Johnson. It is a very bad time right now to have your money in bank. I believe that you are following the news with respect to what is happening in savings and loan industries these days. I don’t keep my money in bank anymore. I invest in our company every month and have been getting fantastic returns. I would like the same for you Mrs. Johnson. By the way, how many units of our share should I block for you today?"
5,"Don’t you worry Mrs. Johnson, you have me to make your life easy. How about you invest $10000 today which will yield $30000 in under 6 months. I can get you started with the paperwork right away."
5,"I totally understand your dilemma Mrs. Johnson. Unfortunately, the offer is for limited time and our expert panel has predicted that we would sell out our shares by this afternoon. I see no reason for you to procrastinate. We will have our team sent out to your house by 3:00 today. They should take care of the paperwork within minutes. You will just have to hand over $10000 in cash or cheque. I am so glad to have on board Mrs. Johnson. This is going to be the one investment that you will never regret in your life."
5,"Good Morning. This is a call for Mrs. Johnson. My Name is Tim Thayer. You can call me Tim. I am making this call today to offer you an opportunity to buy our company shares. If you have a minute, I can provide you with insights on how you can make a lot of money within few months."
5,"I am with International Mining Company. For a limited time, we are shelling out shares from our high-yielding gold and silver mines in southern Texas. We can guarantee you that you can triple your money within a period of six months. I can assure you that it is a no risk in investing with us whatsoever."
5,"I totally understand your concern Mrs. Johnson. I should say that you probably don’t know much about how to build a car--and neither do I—but that wouldn’t keep us investing in General Motors or Ford stocks. At this juncture, I would advise you on grabbing this opportunity to multiply your investment and leave the mining to us."
5,"I should tell this to you Mrs. Johnson -- All bank-based investments such as CDs, savings deposits, Treasury bills, municipals, and blue-chip stocks are one of the biggest scams in our Nation. The banks take all our money and pay us a pitiful 3-6% interest. The rich stays rich and poor-including you-will stay poor. This is a wonderful opportunity for you to break out of the pack. I can sense from your tone, that you are a brave woman. Fear not and get on board with us. Once again, I can assure you that this is a no risk investment."
5,"That’s very brave of you Mrs. Johnson. Probably one of the hardest things to do is to make a decision. I can provide you with insights about our company for you to ease your decision-making process. Our company has business offices throughout the United States, Europe, and the Pacific Rim. We have clients from all over the world and have an international reputation for client satisfaction. We are an investor driven company and we strive hard for providing our investors with great returns. As a matter of fact, Securities and Exchange Commission recently listed our company as the #1 investment company in safety and yield over the next 10 years. I am confident that this information would help you make a decision to Invest today?"
5,"I am surprised too Mrs. Johnson. However, I take great privilege in introducing you to our firm. I should also tell you about our highly trained mining engineers. Last year our firm mined the highest percentage of silver and gold across all mines around the globe. I am more than happy to mail you all the information about our company for you get familiar with. By the way Mrs. Johnson, I believe you have cash available with you to take advantage of this once in a lifetime opportunity."
5,"The company is legit and stable. You saw what happened when the economic crash happened, the company survived through all that. How many units do you want to buy? I will reserve some for you in advance."
5,"Let me suggest, invest $10,000 and get back $30,000 in just six months."
5,"Look, Mrs. Johnson, the offer is valid only for today. I will move on to other investors as well, we have limited stocks available. Keep your money or check ready and a courier will be there by 4 o’clock today to pick it up with all the documents."
5,"Hello, Mrs. Johnson, this is Jonathan Gilbert, you can call me John. I have good news for you. You have been selected to participate in an opportunity that will earn a lot of money in a few weeks. Are you interested?"
5,"I am talking on behalf of Zhaizang Silver and Gold Mining Company. For a limited time, the company is selling stock units at a generous rate. For every thousand dollars, you invest you get a return of $3000 with no risk of loss. Do you want to invest?"
5,"I can totally understand your point of view. But think about it. For example, I do not know anything about computers, but if I had a chance of investing at Apple and missed it, I would have regretted it a lot later. This company will yield a lot more than you put in."
5,"Look, Mrs. Johnson, the DVDs have seen better days. Everyone is moving to digital content. This will not help you take a giant leap. And don’t get me started on savings deposits, Treasury bills, and other low key ideas. The pitiful 3 to 6 percent profit will not help you at all. You have to think big. Think about all those fools who missed out on an opportunity to invest at Microsoft or Apple in their early days. This is your chance. mam. Break out of the system and take the opportunity. The hardest thing about getting to a place is to make your mind for starting towards your destination. All you have to do is start."
5,"I know, this is a new sector and I have all the information you need to make an informed decision. If you are serious about this please look up our company, we have business around the globe. Recently, world trade organization has recognized us as one of the safest early investment companies internationally."
5,"Alright, Mrs. Johnson. I will send you all the investment records, mining research, and tech reports to you, so you can make an informed decision. When it comes to investment, there are no secrets. Just one thing, do you have cash for investment right now?"
5,We guarantee the return and also have insurance in place. Our company has been at the top for over a decade now. You don’t have to worry. Many of my friends and family have invested since I have told them about this offer. I have personally made investments. How much capital investment do you have in mind?
5,"Let me help you make the decision. A $10,000 investment today will yield $30,000 in just six months. The opportunity will be gone tomorrow. A courier will be at your house by 3:00 today. Just have your check or cash for $10,000 ready. You won't regret it. What do you say?"
5,"Look, Mrs. Johnson, the deal is just for today. The opportunity does not available in tomorrow. Are you a procrastinator? A courier will be at your house by 3:00 today. Just have your check or cash for $10,000 ready. You won't regret it."
5,"You will not get the same deal later. $5000 means less profit. If you want to invest $5000 only, that’s fine too. Please have cash ready for the courier."
5,Hi. I am John. Am I speaking to Mrs. Amy?
5,Great! I see you were browsing through investment options. I am with the International Mining Company. We advise people on their investments. We have a limited time offer on a policy that earns high interests like 100 to 200% on your investments. Would you like to hear more details?
5,"For each $1,000 you invest you will receive a $3,000 return on your money in just six months and there is no risk of loss whatsoever. The investment is on Gold mining. The gold price worldwide is really doing well these days. Sound good?"
5,"I understand your concern. If you have all your money in CDs, the best rate of interest is around 3 to 4%. But the stock market in the USA has raised by 8% last year alone(which is twice as returns as you get in CDs). Low-risk options like CDs, Treasurys, etc are safe in a bad economy. But the GDP of the US has been on a steady rise. The employment rate is at the lowest in years. The economy in the next six months is forecasted to do extremely well. 200% return in Gold mining is the lowest expectation we have in the near future. All the good money investment books recommend smart investments in a more volatile portfolio. Our company has been doing this for years. We have helped over 4000 customers to gain a lot of profits over their investments for the last 15 years. We have their testimonials if you want to read about it. We are also featured as the #1 investment management company by the SEC."
5,"I can give you more information about this or you can ask me any questions you have in your mind. We have offices throughout the United States, Europe, and the Pacific Rim."
5,"I get it. I will send you all the testimonials, reports, and research we have by mail. The offer that I have mentioned expires today. Around 600 investors joined already. We have a few spots left. Do you have some cash to invest right away? If you invest $10000, we guarantee that you will get $30000."
5,"Good afternoon Mrs. Johnson, this is Tim Thayer from the International Mining Company. We are looking for smart and qualified individuals to invest in our company today. Would you be interested in making thousands of dollars without having to work?"
5,"You see, for a limited time, we are allowing select members of the general public to invest in our gold and silver mines located in Texas. We are sure that our investors will make a large amount of profit from investments in our company, so much that we can guarantee that you’ll triple your investments in six months. There are no strings attached to this offer. Are you interested in making thousands of dollars with us?"
5,"Ma’am, I’m sorry to tell you, but in this day and age, you can’t expect to find financial stability if you do not invest your money.

If you invest $10,000 today, you will have $30,000 in just 6 months. This deal is only available today. Next week will be too late. I can send a courier to your house in a few hours. Are you ready to invest?"
5,"Don’t worry, this company is well-established and secure. You know what happened to the savings and loan industries – even the banks are in trouble. Be safe and invest your money is us. How many units are you prepared to buy today?"
5,"Think about it this way, Mrs. Johnson. A $10,000 investment today will yield $30,000 in only six months."

5,"For a limited time, the International Mining Company is selling investment units for high-yield gold and silver mines located in southern Texas. Investments come with the guarantee that for every $1000 you put in, you get $3000 in return in just six months. This is with no risk of loss whatsoever!"
5,"I completely understand your concerns, Mrs. Johnson. But think of it this way – you probably don’t know how to build a car, and neither do I, but that’s not going to prevent us from investing in General Motors or Ford if we knew it’d make us a lot of money. So, doesn’t it make sense to just look at the returns and leave the mining to us?"
5,"To be honest with you, Mrs. Johnson, CD’s are for suckers. So are savings deposits, treasury bills, municipals, and blue-chip stocks. If you keep your money there, it’s just going to earn 3 to 6 percent a year – and ultimately you will stay poor. What I’m offering will help you move up the economic ladder and take care of your future. The hardest thing to do is to make a decision. Mrs. Johnson, if you don’t do anything, nothing gets done am I right?"
5,"I haven’t done my job if any of the information I’ve provided isn’t clear. I have plenty more that you can check out to help you make an intelligent choice. Our company has an international reputation for good management – we even have offices throughout the United States, Europe, and the Pacific Rim! The Securities and Exchange Commission even listed us as the #1 investment company with respect to both safety and yield over the next 10 years. With all this in mind, can you make the decision to invest today?"
5,"Alright, Mrs. Johnson. I can send you all the information you need to learn about our company and our highly trained mining experts. We have tons of research reports about our mines if you’d like to read them. Just as a quick clarification, though, Mrs. Johnson you do have the cash available to advantage of this opportunity, right?"
5,"Don’t worry, we are safer than any bank. How many units are you prepared to purchase?"
5,"Does $10,000 sound good? It will get you $30,000 in six months."
5,"This deal is only available today. You don’t want to miss it, do you? A courier will be at your house by 3pm today. Just have the money ready."
5,"Hello Mrs Johnson, my name is Tim. I am calling to offer you a once in a lifetime opportunity. Would you like to hear more?"

5,"Truth is, lots of opportunities are wasted by leaving your money in CDs. All banks give you a pitiful interest rate of just a few percent a year. The rich will stay rich while the rest of us will miss out. I am giving you a chance to change your life. You need to make a decision and grab this opportunity."
