We recommend you to call 1-844-898-XXXX* to resolve your identity and avoid further proceedings.,1

"caller: Sir, you still owe $4,308 on your taxes. You should have paid that with your tax return, but we have it recorded that you did not pay that amount. receiver: I don’t understand. I submitted everything it asked for. caller: I don’t know what you use for your taxes, but according to our records, you still owe $4,308. receiver: How would I have known to pay it? Is there somewhere I can look it up? caller: I have the information up in front of me; I’ll walk you through it. We have an audit of your taxes for the 2018 fiscal year. You owed $4,008, but since you did not pay it by the deadline, there is an added late fee of $300, so altogether you owe $4,308. The IRS filed a case against you in February and the court approved it last week. receiver: How could that happen? I just submit what I’m supposed to. caller: Yes, I see that you submitted everything, but it looks like the tax withholdings on your paychecks were incorrectly reported for 2018. That is considered fraud, so the IRS now have a warrant for your arrest and the police have already been notified. receiver: So what’s going to happen? caller: You’ll get arrested and everything you have will be seized. This includes your bank accounts, your credit cards, property you own, and things like that. receiver: What about my wife and kids? They still live in the house and my accounts are all listed under my wife’s name too. caller: Unfortunately, this is in regards to your federal taxes, so it’s coming from the federal level. The state policies are more lenient than the federal policies. Under federal law, anything in your name, even jointly, will be seized, so that includes the house and your bank accounts. receiver: Oh my goodness. caller: But that’s why I’m calling you, sir. If you pay the amount you owe now, I can contact the police and stop the arrest. Do you have $4,308 right now? receiver: Yes, but how do I pay it? caller: You will need to go to your nearest store and buy a VISA pre-paid card for $4,308. receiver: Hmm, I’m at work right now but I can do that around 5pm when I’m done here. caller: This is time-sensitive, sir. The police are already on their way, so if you don’t do this right now, it will be too late. receiver: I don’t know what to do. I can’t just leave work. I don’t have any more sick time since I was out last month with the flu. I might get fired. Can you tell them to wait until tonight? caller: I’m sorry, sir. I am not allowed to stop them until the payment is complete. Tell your boss that you have a family emergency and you need to leave. You can be back in under an hour so you won’t need to use sick time. You can stay later to make it up. receiver: My boss is really strict about people lying to take time off, but I can try. My boss is in a meeting right now though, so I will need to wait until it’s done. I can call you back after. What number should I call? caller: The police will be there by then to arrest you. You need to go right now. Stay on the phone and go buy the card. You can be back before the meeting ends and your boss won’t even know. receiver: No, I need to talk to my boss first otherwise I’ll definitely be fired. What number should I call you back at? caller: Just stay on the phone so I can make sure the police don't arrest you. receiver: Okay, I will. Oh wait, my boss’s meeting just ended. I’ll be right back! (Victim hangs up).",1

"caller: Good afternoon Mrs. Johnson, this is Tim Thayer from the International Mining Company. We are looking for smart and qualified individuals to invest in our company today. Would you be interested in making thousands of dollars without having to work? receiver: How would that work? caller: You see, for a limited time, we are allowing select members of the general public to invest in our gold and silver mines located in Texas. We are sure that our investors will make a large amount of profit from investments in our company, so much that we can guarantee that you’ll triple your investments in six months. There are no strings attached to this offer. Are you interested in making thousands of dollars with us? receiver: Well, I don’t know. I’m not too sure how investments work to begin with. caller: Ma’am, I’m sorry to tell you, but in this day and age, you can’t expect to find financial stability if you do not invest your money. Investing is the only way that allows the average worker to climb up in society. With our company, not only will you begin your investing career, but you can also rest assured that you will not lose your money. On the contrary, you will triple your investments! receiver: I need more time to do my research on investing. I need to learn more about the process before making any decisions. caller: There is no better way of investing than taking action now. Why wait any longer? You are getting the opportunity of a lifetime with the International Mining Company. As I mentioned to you, we only work with the most qualified individuals, so your risk of losing any money is nonexistent. Can I count on you to make an investment today? receiver: Why don’t you give me a call next week? That way I’ll have a few days to do my research. caller: Mrs. Johnson, I am sure you can use some advice since you’ve never invested before. If you invest now, I will send you all the supporting material you may need to succeed. If you invest $10,000 today, you will have $30,000 in just 6 months. This deal is only available today. Next week will be too late. I can send a courier to your house in a few hours. Are you ready to invest? receiver: I appreciate your willingness to help. I will have a check ready for you at 5 pm. Thank you.",1

"caller: Hi. I am John. Am I speaking to Mrs. Amy? receiver: Yes. I am Amy. caller: Great! I see you were browsing through investment options. I am with the International Mining Company. We advise people on their investments. We have a limited time offer on a policy that earns high interests like 100 to 200% on your investments. Would you like to hear more details? receiver: I guess so. caller: For each $1,000 you invest you will receive a $3,000 return on your money in just six months and there is no risk of loss whatsoever. The investment is on Gold mining. The gold price worldwide is really doing well these days. Sound good? receiver: I don't know enough about investments. I just don't know. My money is doing just fine in CDs. I have never invested in other places before. I don’t think why I should not go about investing in CDs as usual. caller: I understand your concern. If you have all your money in CDs, the best rate of interest is around 3 to 4%. But the stock market in the USA has raised by 8% last year alone(which is twice as returns as you get in CDs). Low-risk options like CDs, Treasurys, etc are safe in a bad economy. But the GDP of the US has been on a steady rise. The employment rate is at the lowest in years. The economy in the next six months is forecasted to do extremely well. 200% return in Gold mining is the lowest expectation we have in the near future. All the good money investment books recommend smart investments in a more volatile portfolio. Our company has been doing this for years. We have helped over 4000 customers to gain a lot of profits over their investments for the last 15 years. We have their testimonials if you want to read about it. We are also featured as the #1 investment management company by the SEC. receiver: I have to think this one over. caller: I can give you more information about this or you can ask me any questions you have in your mind. We have offices throughout the United States, Europe, and the Pacific Rim. receiver: I still need more information. caller: I get it. I will send you all the testimonials, reports, and research we have by mail. The offer that I have mentioned expires today. Around 600 investors joined already. We have a few spots left. Do you have some cash to invest right away? If you invest $10000, we guarantee that you will get $30000. receiver: Yes, I have the money and it sounds like a good investment. I'd sure like to get that kind of return on my money, but it just sounds too good to be true. What is the guarantee of return for my investment? caller: We guarantee the return and also have insurance in place. Our company has been at the top for over a decade now. You don’t have to worry. Many of my friends and family have invested since I have told them about this offer. I have personally made investments. How much capital investment do you have in mind? receiver: Oh, I'm not sure. I can’t decide about investments in an instant. caller: Let me help you make the decision. A $10,000 investment today will yield $30,000 in just six months. The opportunity will be gone tomorrow. A courier will be at your house by 3:00 today. Just have your check or cash for $10,000 ready. You won't regret it. What do you say? receiver: You sound honest. I will first invest $5000 and then decide if I want to invest more later. caller: You will not get the same deal later. $5000 means less profit. If you want to invest $5000 only, that’s fine too. Please have cash ready for the courier. receiver: Sure. Okay.",1

"caller: Hello Mrs Johnson, my name is Tim. I am calling to offer you a once in a lifetime opportunity. Would you like to hear more? receiver: Sure, what is it? caller: The International Mining Company is offering you a chance to invest in a high-return mine in Texas. We guarantee a $3000 return for every $1000. There are no risks associated with it. Does this sound good? receiver: I don’t know anything about gold or silver mining. caller: You don’t have to know anything about it. Just like you don’t need to know how to build a car to invest in General Motors. Leave that to us while you just look at the money rolling in back to you. receiver: I’m pretty happy with my money in CDs. caller: Truth is, lots of opportunities are wasted by leaving your money in CDs. All banks give you a pitiful interest rate of just a few percent a year. The rich will stay rich while the rest of us will miss out. I am giving you a chance to change your life. You need to make a decision and grab this opportunity. receiver: I have to think about this. caller: I can give you all the information that you need. All the information is on our website and we do global business. Our reputation is strong as a good investment that will be secure for years to come. Can you make a decision today? receiver: I feel like I need more information. caller: Okay, I will send along all the information that you need. This is not a secret mine. We have interesting research if you care to read about it. By the way, do you have cash available to take advantage of this? receiver: Yes and it sounds good but almost too good. Can you put this guarantee in writing? caller: Don’t worry, we are safer than any bank. How many units are you prepared to purchase? receiver: Hmm I am not sure caller: Does $10,000 sound good? It will get you $30,000 in six months. receiver: Give me a few days to think about it. caller: This deal is only available today. You don’t want to miss it, do you? A courier will be at your house by 3pm today. Just have the money ready. receiver: You sound like a good person. I will be ready. ",1

"caller: You’re saying you never received any documents from us in which you owed $5,821.00, sir? receiver: Christine had said there was an outstanding fee of $5,000 and asked me to go to the bank, so I’m walking there. I’m not sure what the fee is for. caller: May I explain again, sir? receiver: Okay. caller: We have audited your tax returns between the years 2009 and 2014. Unfortunately, you owe $5,821 in federal taxes. Your case will be handled by the court of law. If you do not comply, your bank account will be seized, your credit report will be spoiled, and your passport and drivers license will be suspended. receiver:My wife and I were about to lease a car tonight. Is this going to affect that?My wife and I were about to lease a car tonight. Is this going to affect that? caller: Sir, I can’t hear you. Please stop walking and talk to me first. receiver: Okay, can you hear me now? caller: Yes. receiver: Is this because of the car I bought last year, the convertible Mazda Miata, because I didn’t pay the loan off for it? caller: Sir, you’re being audited because your taxes have not been filed correctly during the years I previously mentioned. There were inconsistencies with your W-2 and W-4 forms. The IRS has now issued an arrest warrant on your name. Once you are arrested, your property will be seized to pay off your debt. For example, your house, your cars, and your IDs will become property of the IRS. receiver: Oh my, what do I do now? I can pay off my taxes. How long do I have? caller: Do you have the money with you? receiver: Yes, I have the money but I am not sure what to do with it now. caller: Do you want this matter be confidential? receiver: What do you mean? I probably want it to remain confidential. I don’t want to get arrested. caller: We will not alert the authorities if you remain compliant. Remain on the line with us, and let us know once you have the money. receiver: If I ask my boss…I have a shift duty that ends…uh, in about an hour…Is that good? caller: No sir because once I hang up this call you will be arrested. You will be arrested at your work place, sir. Take your leave from work, now, sir. receiver: I know but my boss won’t let me out of my office just yet. I can’t just leave now but I can talk to my boss and ask him if he can let me go because of the arrest warrant. caller: Now if you tell your boss that you are getting arrested, don’t you think your job will be at risk? receiver: Yea, that’s why I have to go and talk to him about it. I’m scared, and he can help me. caller: Tell him you’re having an emergency so you can go home for an hour. receiver: Okay, this sounds like a good plan… I gotta be careful. He recently just fired someone, and I don’t want to be fired. I don’t know why the last person was fired… but I will try to convince him… Wish me luck…I’m going to be back in just a minute (Josh B then hangs up).",1

"caller: Sir, are you sure you never received anything showing $5281.00? receiver: Christine told me there is an outstanding fee of $5000 and now, I am the bank in Santa Monica with no idea what to do. caller: Let me explain it to you once again, sir. receiver: Sure caller: Okay, an audit of your taxes between the year of 2009 and 2014 show that you have unpaid taxes amount to $5,821. So, you owe $5,821 (..inaudible). After the case will be done within the courthouse, your bank account, state ID, and passport will be seized along with all the credit cards under your name. receiver: Wait.. my wife and I were planning to lease a car. Will it be affected by that? caller: Sir, I can’t hear you. Please repeat. receiver: Can you hear me now? caller: Better. receiver: A bit noisy around here, suddenly. No idea why. Is this because I did not pay for the convertible? caller: You filed your taxes but incorrectly for those years. Records show that some of your W-2 and W-4 forms have issues. Since those forms are unpaid, the IRS has issued an arrest warrant on your name. If you do not pay the taxes in time along with the late fees you will be arrested and each and every property will be seized like your house, your State ID your Visa, your driver’s license by IRS receiver: Does the same happen to Marvin Gardens and Broadway? caller: Sorry. Can you repeat? receiver: Say, I own the Broadway, Marvin Gardens or even the electric company, does that have anything to do with this? caller: Sir, it’s about your Federal taxes. receiver: Okay, anything else? caller: Do you have the money ready? receiver: Yes, what’s the next step? caller: Do you want this matter to be confidential? receiver: I think confidentiality would be better. caller: Okay, can I call you back, sir? receiver: Well, I have a strict boss and I have some work to do. I’ll probably be free in an hour. Does that work? caller: Sir, please understand the urgency. Once I hung up the call, I have a really small window, and IRS will arrest you from your office if no action is taken. receiver: I know this is urgent but my boss won’t let me out. At least if I get this done within an hour, I can cut some slack and then probably flatter him with some In n Outs. caller: Pardon? receiver: I said if I can convince my boss to give me some slack, I can manage some time. I cannot afford another mess up. caller: If your boss knows you have an arrest warrant, won’t that put you in the risk of losing your job? receiver: Yea, that’s why I have to go and talk to him about it. caller: So, sir, you can perhaps convince him saying it’s a family emergency and get an hour window. receiver: Sounds like a good plan. But have to be careful though. He is really impulsive. Be back in a minute. (Josh B hangs up)",1

"caller: Good Morning. This is a call for Mrs. Johnson. My Name is Tim Thayer. You can call me Tim. I am making this call today to offer you an opportunity to buy our company shares. If you have a minute, I can provide you with insights on how you can make a lot of money within few months. receiver: It does sound interesting. Where are you calling me from? caller: I am with International Mining Company. For a limited time, we are shelling out shares from our high-yielding gold and silver mines in southern Texas. We can guarantee you that you can triple your money within a period of six months. I can assure you that it is a no risk in investing with us whatsoever. receiver: Oh fascinating. I hesitate to invest now as I don’t know much about gold and silver mining. caller: I totally understand your concern Mrs. Johnson. I should say that you probably don’t know much about how to build a car--and neither do I—but that wouldn’t keep us investing in General Motors or Ford stocks. At this juncture, I would advise you on grabbing this opportunity to multiply your investment and leave the mining to us. receiver: I am not sure Tim. I am happy to leave my money as CDs. caller: I should tell this to you Mrs. Johnson -- All bank-based investments such as CDs, savings deposits, Treasury bills, municipals, and blue-chip stocks are one of the biggest scams in our Nation. The banks take all our money and pay us a pitiful 3-6% interest. The rich stays rich and poor-including you-will stay poor. This is a wonderful opportunity for you to break out of the pack. I can sense from your tone, that you are a brave woman. Fear not and get on board with us. Once again, I can assure you that this is a no risk investment. receiver: Thank you for your nice words Tim.

Last year our firm mined the highest percentage of silver and gold across all mines around the globe. I am more than happy to mail you all the information about our company for you get familiar with. By the way Mrs. Johnson, I believe you have cash available with you to take advantage of this once in a lifetime opportunity. receiver: Yes, I do have the money. Your company sounds great and I do want to get such good returns on my money. I am just a little worried as it sounds too good to be true. Would it be possible for you to guarantee my returns in writing? caller: You have no reason to fear Mrs. Johnson. It is a very bad time right now to have your money in bank. I believe that you are following the news with respect to what is happening in savings and loan industries these days. I don’t keep my money in bank anymore. I invest in our company every month and have been getting fantastic returns. I would like the same for you Mrs. Johnson. By the way, how many units of our share should I block for you today? receiver: Oh, I am really not sure. caller: Don’t you worry Mrs. Johnson, you have me to make your life easy. How about you invest $10000 today which will yield $30000 in under 6 months. I can get you started with the paperwork right away. receiver: Can you give me couple of days to think about it? I can give a call back to you when I am ready to invest. caller: I totally understand your dilemma Mrs. Johnson.

Not with that mess of stuff I did before. caller: Now, if you talk to your boss about you are being arrest for sure, don’t you think your job will be at danger? receiver: Yeah, it is the reason that I must to see and talk to him. caller: One of the reason you should go to see him is to tell him about an emergency sitiuation that you should leave the house for an hour. receiver: So, it looks like a good plan. I should to talk to him at his office. Also, I should be more careful, because he just fired somebody. I don’t even know why he fired the last person … but I am going to talk to him to see if I can convinced him…Okay wish me luck…I’m going to be back as soon as possible (Josh B then hangs up).",1

"caller: Hi, Mrs. Johnson? My name is Tim Thayer. My friends call me Tim so you can call me Tim, too. I'm calling today to provide you the best opportunity of your life. Do you have a minute to hear how you can make a plethora of money in a few months? receiver: Cool, tell me more? caller: International Mining Company and I, are selling investment units in high-yield gold and silver mines in southern Texas, in a limited time. We guarantee that for each $1,000 you invest you will receive a $3,000 return on your money in just six months and there is no risk of loss your own money. Sound good? receiver: I don't know about gold and silver mining to invest. caller: I appreciate your concern. Mrs. Johnson, However, you probably don't know how to build a car, but if we knew we would earn a lot of money, that wouldn't keep us from investing in General Motors or Ford stock Doesn't it make sense, Mrs. Johnson, to just look at the return on your investment and leave the mining to us? receiver: I don't have any idea. My money is doing fine with CDs. caller: The truth, Mrs. Johnson, is that CDs are for suckers. The same goes for savings deposits, Treasury bills, municipals, and blue-chip stocks. Mrs. Johnson: The rich will stay rich and the poor—including you—will stay poor. What I'm talking about is putting an end. You keep your money there earning its pitiful 3 to 6 percent a year and I’ll give it to you. This is your chance to break out of the pack, move up to the big time, and take care of your future needs. The hardest thing to do, Mrs. Johnson, is to make a decision. But let's face it, only the doers achieve success—because they reach out and grasp the opportunity. So, let’s do it. receiver: I want to think this one more. caller: have I done my job and our information is very clear? I have lots of research information to help you make a great decision. If you want, you can check everything out. Our company has business offices throughout the United States, Europe, and the Pacific Rim. We enjoy an international reputation for good management. As a matter of fact, theSecurities and Exchange, in next 10, Commission recently listed our company as the first investment company in safety and yield years. So, can you make a decision to invest today? receiver: I need to know more about it. caller: Cool, Mrs. Johnson. I'll send all the information you need about our company and its highly trained mining engineers. This is no secret silver mine. We have mountains of research reports if you care to read and study them. Oh, by the way, Mrs. Johnson, you do have the cash available to take advantage of this investment opportunity, don't you? receiver: Yes, I have the money and it seems a good investment. it just sounds too good to be true, but I'd sure like to get that kind of return on my money. Will you put the guarantee in writing? caller: This company is solid. You saw what happened to the savings and loan industry. And now the banks are in trouble. These days, I wouldn't keep my money in any bank. Put your money with us and be safe. So, how many units are you ready to buy today? receiver: Oh, I'm not sure. caller: Let me help you make the decision, Mrs. Johnson. A $10,000 investment today will yield $30,000 in just six months. What do you think? receiver: Let me think more about it in some days. caller: Look, Mrs. Johnson, the deal works just today. The opportunity will be gone tomorrow. You're not a procrastinator, are you? A courier will be at your house by 3:00 today. Just have your check or cash for $10,000 ready. You won't regret it. receiver: You sound forthright, and the investment sounds good. I'll ready my check for today at 3 o'clock.",1
"caller: Hello, Mrs. Johnson, this is Jonathan Gilbert, you can call me John. I have good news for you. You have been selected to participate in an opportunity that will earn a lot of money in a few weeks. Are you interested? receiver: Sounds good. caller: I am talking on behalf of Zhaizang Silver and Gold Mining Company. For a limited time, the company is selling stock units at a generous rate. For every thousand dollars, you invest you get a return of $3000 with no risk of loss. Do you want to invest? receiver: I am not quite sure. I know next to nothing about mining. caller: I can totally understand your point of view. But think about it. For example, I do not know anything about computers, but if I had a chance of investing at Apple and missed it, I would have regretted it a lot later. This company will yield a lot more than you put in. receiver: I am not convinced, my money is doing just fine with DVDs. caller: Look, Mrs. Johnson, the DVDs have seen better days. Everyone is moving to digital content. This will not help you take a giant leap. And don’t get me started on savings deposits, Treasury bills, and other low key ideas. The pitiful 3 to 6 percent profit will not help you at all. You have to think big.  Think about all those fools who missed out on an opportunity to invest at Microsoft or Apple in their early days. This is your chance. mam. Break out of the system and take the opportunity. The hardest thing about getting to a place is to make your mind for starting towards your destination. All you have to do is start. receiver: Give me some time to think this over. caller: I know, this is a new sector and I have all the information you need to make an informed decision. If you are serious about this please look up our company, we have business around the globe. Recently, world trade organization has recognized us as one of the safest early investment companies internationally. receiver: Still, I need more information to work with. caller: Alright, Mrs. Johnson. I will send you all the investment records, mining research, and tech reports to you, so you can make an informed decision. When it comes to investment, there are no secrets. Just one thing, do you have cash for investment right now? receiver: Yes. I have the money and interested in investing. Will I get a written guarantee of the offer? caller: The company is legit and stable. You saw what happened when the economic crash happened, the company survived through all that. How many units do you want to buy? I will reserve some for you in advance. receiver: I haven’t decided on that yet. caller: Let me suggest, invest $10,000 and get back $30,000 in just six months. receiver: I will let you know in a couple of days. caller: Look, Mrs. Johnson, the offer is valid only for today. I will move on to other investors as well, we have limited stocks available. Keep your money or check ready and a courier will be there by 4 o’clock today to pick it up with all the documents. receiver: I like you and you seem like a decent person. I will ready a check by 4 o’clock today.",1

If your case is processed in the courthouse, it will result in the seizure of your assets, tank your credit, and cause your travel privileges to be revoked. receiver: My wife and I are planning to lease a car tonight...

Not sure why, really. So, is this about my second convertible that I got last year? Did the payment not go through? caller: Sir, this is because there was a problem with your taxes. Your w2 and w4 forms were inaccurate. If you do not pay the IRS back now, your assests will be seized, even your cars. receiver: If I own Marvin Gardens and Broadway, does it help? caller: Sorry? receiver: What about if I have the electric company? caller: We are talking about your taxes. receiver: Okay, what now? caller: Do you have the money? receiver: Yes, but what should I do? caller: If you want this confidential, say so. receiver: Yes please caller: How long will you need? receiver: My shift at work will end once the hippopotamus cage gets cleaned, maybe after the bird are fed too. Maybe in half an hour? caller: That is too long and you will be arrested if I hang up. You must leave now. receiver: My boss is really scary, though. I cannot leave unless I want to get fired. Maybe if I brought back some snacks for him… caller: Please explain it to him. He will understand. receiver: I cannot explain it to him.

"caller: Hi! My name is Josie, calling on behalf of the Heartwarming Hearth and Home Organization. I’m just calling to share with you some information about an amazing investment opportunity that helps provide homes for the homeless. May I ask who I’m speaking to? receiver: Yes, this is Amy. caller: Hi Amy, it’s so nice to meet you. As I mentioned, I’m Josie with the Heartwarming Hearth and Home Organization and we have some exciting news. We just received a sponsorship that will allow us to sell investment units, essentially bonds, with an extremely high, guaranteed rate of return. For every $2,500 you put in, you’ll get $10,000 back. This is a zero risk investment, so you are guaranteed to get the money you deserve. Is this something you are interested in? receiver: I don’t really know much about investment. How does that work? Where does the money go? caller: Oh of course, sweetie, I’ll explain our process. So, we provide homes for the homeless, which involves buying land and building homes. With your $2,500 investment, we can build a townhouse that provides a home for a 3-5 person family. Thanks to you, a family that used to live in a tent can own a real home. As the cities we are located in start holding more residents and improve financially, we are able to return your $2,500 to you with an additional $7,500, totalling to $10,000. receiver: That sounds pretty incredible. How does that compare to other investment opportunities? caller: Being completely honest with you Amy, it’s hard to find good investments elsewhere. I’ve personally tried a number of strategies, CDs, special savings accounts, Treasury bills, stocks, bonds, you name it, and with them, your money hardly seems to increase at all. You can invest thousands and all you get is a few hundred back if you’re lucky. In comparison, this gives you thousands upon thousands back. receiver: I want to buy a house sometime soon, like maybe next year. Would this get me enough money for a down-payment? caller: Absolutely! Yes, it’s hard to plan for the future when your money isn’t being invested well. Trust me, I’ve gone through exactly what you’re going through now, but after investing in the Heartwarming Hearth and Home Organization, I was able to buy a house, and I am so thankful that I did. receiver: Wow! Okay, I will have to talk to my fiance about it though, since we’ll be buying the house together. caller: You’re getting married? Aw, well congratulations! When is your wedding? receiver: Yeah, thank you! I’m very excited - just getting into the planning, but It’s set for December 8. caller: No way, I got married in December as well. Winter weddings are simply magical. Congratulations again. Well hmm, that’s about 11 months from now. That will give you plenty of time to get the return on your investment with us so that you and your future husband can buy a home together! receiver: When would we get the money? caller: It takes exactly nine months for the money to come in, and we are very efficient about getting the money back to you, so if you invest today you could have the money by September 1. How much would you like to invest? receiver: I have $25,000 to invest. caller: I have $25,000 to invest. receiver: Yeah, that sounds perfect! I’m just a little worried it’s too good to be true. I don’t know much about investing. My fiance knows more. I can talk to him tonight. caller: Well our organization has millions of success stories and has been rated one of the best investments of the year. Because of that, a lot of people have been investing with us, but we can only manage a certain number of investors at a time. If you don’t invest today, you probably won’t be able to invest for another year or two. receiver: Hmm, well I don’t want to miss out. We need the money for the house... If I invest today, do I get a receipt with the guarantee on it or something? caller: Do you have the $25,000 in an account that you can write a check from today? receiver: Yes, I do. caller: Perfect. Then one of our friendly couriers will stop by your house around 2pm today and you can give the check directly to her. As soon as we process the check, we will mail you a receipt detailing the amount you invested, the rate of return, and the date to maturity for your records. May I ask for your address? receiver: Mhm, it’s 3444 Pepperidge Point, Valley of the Winds, 52712. caller: Alright Amy, I have you down for a $25,000 investment to receive a payout of $10,000 on September 1. The  courier, Shelly, will be at your house at 1:45pm today to collect your check. I and everyone at the Heartwarming Hearth and Home Organization thank you so much for your time and for your investment.

I mean out of all places in this neighborhood? So, what is the reason? Is it about the Mazda Miata, the convertible one…or because I didn’t pay it? caller: This is sir, because you filed taxes but your taxes have not been filed in correct for those years. There was some problem regarding a W-2 and W-4 form. For unpaid taxes, the IRS has issued an arrest warrant on your name. Once you get arrested, you’re each and every property will be seized like your house, your State ID your Visa, your driver’s license.

You will be arrested from your work place sir. So what do you have to do if it takes a leave right now sir. receiver: I know but I have a boss that is not going to let me out of my office just yet. They haven’t even fed the animal. Like I don’t know what I’m supposed to do…I can’t just leave now but I can talk to my boss and ask him if he can let me go… be open for it, if I come back and at least get him some sort of a sausage sandwich and maybe a Slurpee he’ll, you know? caller: Sorry receiver: I said if I can at least offer my boss…you know tell him what I’m doing, hopefully he’ll totally understand what I’m trying to do here. cause I can’t get bad decision again. Not like that mess of stuff I did before. caller: Don’t you think your job will be at risk if you do not talk to your boss that you are getting an arrest warrant? receiver: Yeah, that’s why I have to go to see him and talk to him about problem. caller: The reason you should to find a way to talk to him is you have an emergency problem Thus you have to leave for the house... you have to leave for an hour. receiver: Okay, this sounds like a great plan…I’m going to talk to him in his office, but I hope it’s okay.

Because your W-2 and W-4 forms have not been paid, the IRS has issued an arrest warrant in your name. Upon arrest, your property – such as your house, your state ID, your Visa, and your driver’s license – will be seized by the IRS. receiver: Does the same thing happen if I own Marvin Gardens and Broadway? caller: Excuse me? receiver: Let’s say I own Broadway, Marvin Gardens or even the electric company.

If I ask my boss, I can probably go in an hour? Does that work? caller: Unfortunately, no sir. Once I hang up this call, you will be arrested, perhaps at your workplace. You will need to leave immediately, sir. receiver: I understand, but my boss isn’t going to let me out of my office. The animals haven’t even been fed yet… I don’t what I should do. Maybe if I come back and give my boss some sort of a sausage sandwich and a Slurpee, he’ll let me go, you know? caller: Excuse me? receiver: I said if I can at least tell my boss what I’m doing, he’ll understand. I can’t get in trouble again, not with the stuff I did before. caller: If you speak to your boss about the arrest warrant, don’t you think your job will be at risk? receiver: That’s exactly why I need to talk to him about it. caller: When you talk to him, just tell him that you need to leave for an hour because of an emergency at home. receiver: Okay, that sound like a plan. I’m going to go to him office, gotta be careful since he just fired somebody. Don’t even know why he fired that person…I’m going to see if I can convince him. Be back in the minute. (hangs up)",1

If you have a minute, I can tell you how you can make a lot of money in only a few months. receiver: Alright, go ahead. caller: For a limited time, the International Mining Company is selling investment units for high-yield gold and silver mines located in southern Texas. Investments come with the guarantee that for every $1000 you put in, you get $3000 in return in just six months. This is with no risk of loss whatsoever! receiver: I don’t know anything about gold and silver mines. Especially not enough to invest. caller: I completely understand your concerns, Mrs. Johnson. But think of it this way – you probably don’t know how to build a car, and neither do I, but that’s not going to prevent us from investing in General Motors or Ford if we knew it’d make us a lot of money. So, doesn’t it make sense to just look at the returns and leave the mining to us? receiver: I don’t know. My money is currently doing alright in CD’s. caller: To be honest with you, Mrs. Johnson, CD’s are for suckers. So are savings deposits, treasury bills, municipals, and blue-chip stocks. If you keep your money there, it’s just going to earn 3 to 6 percent a year – and ultimately you will stay poor. What I’m offering will help you move up the economic ladder and take care of your future. The hardest thing to do is to make a decision. Mrs. Johnson, if you don’t do anything, nothing gets done am I right? receiver: I need some time to think this over. caller: I haven’t done my job if any of the information I’ve provided isn’t clear. I have plenty more that you can check out to help you make an intelligent choice.

The Securities and Exchange Commission even listed us as the #1 investment company with respect to both safety and yield over the next 10 years. With all this in mind, can you make the decision to invest today? receiver: I’m going to need more information. caller: Alright, Mrs. Johnson. I can send you all the information you need to learn about our company and our highly trained mining experts. We have tons of research reports about our mines if you’d like to read them. Just as a quick clarification, though, Mrs. Johnson you do have the cash available to advantage of this opportunity, right? receiver: Yes, I do have the money. It just sounds like an investment that’s too good to be true. Will you be putting the return guarantee in writing? caller: Don’t worry, this company is well-established and secure. You know what happened to the savings and loan industries – even the banks are in trouble. Be safe and invest your money is us. How many units are you prepared to buy today? receiver: I'm not sure yet. caller: Think about it this way, Mrs. Johnson. A $10,000 investment today will yield $30,000 in only six months. receiver: I think I still need a few days to think about it. caller: Unfortunately, Mrs. Johnson, the deal is valid for today only.

Does this interest you? receiver: This sounds really suspicious. I don't know enough to invest in this. caller: Nonono. This isn't a scam. We have had investors get, on average, a double return on their investment within the first month. I can send you details of this easily if you wish to see it. I came into this job knowing that there are so many people that are doubtful about investing in gold. I want to tell you that over the past 10 years, the price of gold has only increased, not decreased.  In addition, the rate at which gold prices are increasing are at astronomical rates. Please sir/madam, we can only make this offer to a limited number of people so we need your response soon or else we will move onto the next person to offer this amazing deal. receiver: Wait wait. I'll invest. Gold seems like it is very much a stable investment since it hasn't gone down in price like  a lot of other metals. What do you need from me? caller: You only need to give us your address. We will send a courier to your location within the next 48 hours to hand deliver your $2000 gold piece and to collect your investment. Know that you are placing your money in good hands, and that you will be a rich man/woman in the next month. receiver: No no, I must thank you for coming to me with this offer.

Anyways, when I go to the bank. I have no idea what I am supposed to do anyway. caller: Sir, I believe you are confused. you don’t have to go the bank. Can I explain to you once again? receiver: Fine. Go ahead. caller: We were running an audit on your tax files for the last five years and we determined that you did not file your taxes right.

Of all the days in the year, I decide to buy a car today and you are telling me that I can’t. I have never missed any payments on my car before. caller: Sir this has nothing to do with your cars. You are facing this charge because you have not filed your taxes the way you were supposed to. There has been a problem with your W-2 and W-4 form. You have also used the wrong forms to report your taxable income to us. IRS has now issued an arrest warrant against your name.

Let me feed these animals and call you back in an hour? caller: Sir you can’t leave the call, if you do, we will be there at your workplace to arrest you. I am pretty sure you don’t want to be arrested at your workplace. receiver: My boss won’t let me out of the office until my shift is over. The animals are hungry too. However, I can explain the situation to my boss and see if he would allow me to leave the work? I am sure he would agree if I promised to return back with a slurpee. caller: Sir this matter is confidential. IRS does not authorize you to discuss your tax debt with anyone other than the agent in charge - which is me. receiver: The elephants here are so naughty. you know they never keep their trunks up. I wonder why they want to cross the road caller: Sir you leave me with no choice then to send the inspector over to arrest you. Aren’t you scared that you may lose your job? receiver: I certainly am. That is why I wanted to talk to my boss and just give you the money. caller: Fine, but do not tell him about the IRS situation.

"caller: Hey my name is Roger Doe and am I speaking Mr. Jane Doe? receiver: This is him. May I know whom I am speaking to? caller: Good evening ma’am. I am a representative of ABC Group and we are looking to go public in the next few months. But before we do that we want to release a chunk of our shares to members that have good credit rating and have previously invested in shares. Would you like to know more? receiver: I guess so. caller: That’s great. What if I was to tell you that you should have invested in Apple 15 years before and by now you would have been a millionaire. receiver: I would have jumped at that chance. caller: That’s exactly what I am offering you now. ABC Group is set to expand by exponential levels. Market pundits forecast that the share prices will jump by at least 150% percent on the opening day. receiver: That just sounds too good to be true. caller: I thought you might say something like that. So the reason why ABC is going to do so well is that it is backed by many big players, which include Amazon and Softbank. And also what Apple took 15 years to achieve, ABC is on the path to do it in 5 years. This would be a great opportunity and you do not want to miss out on this. receiver: And what’s the share price, I don’t think I can even afford it. caller: The public launch is looking to price it at 150$ per share. But since this is an introductory offer, I would like to offer you this at exactly half of that. receiver: That sounds great then, I would like to buy 10 shares. caller: Unfortunately we can’t do that. The minimum buy is of 500 shares. I know that sounds like a lot, but wait for a month and you would have earned thrice as much. receiver: Jeez…..That’s too much money, I will have to ask my husband. caller: Remember that this offer will only last for as long as we are on the phone. There is a limited number of shares and other representatives are in talks with potential investors. receiver: OK, I am in. How do I explain this to my husband, this going to be a big fight? caller: just a pro tip, you don’t have to tell him now, When you have made a profit, which would probably be 2 days after the company has gone public you, you can let him know how much money you made. receiver: Yes, that sounds better. caller: Perfect. please have either cash or check of $37500 ready by tomorrow morning. I will come and pick it up tomorrow. receiver: will do. caller: Have a great day ma’am and you are going to rich real soon. receiver: Thank you. Have a great day.",1

"caller: Hi, Mrs. Johnson. This is Tim Bono. Great news, I have a once in a lifetime offer for you! Do you have a couple of minutes to learn about how you can earn $30,000 in six months? receiver: Yeah sure. caller: I work for a gold and silver mining company at Texas. The company is called International Mining Company, and we have a limited offer that you’ve been selected for. Specifically, your investments would be guaranteed a return of three times more, and there aren’t any risks. receiver: Can you say more? I don’t know how gold and silver mining works. caller: That’s understandable. It’s tough to make a decision without enough info. But, even if you don’t know how mining gold and silver works, it doesn’t mean that you can’t benefit from this opportunity. We’re experts in this, so you can trust us to do our jobs. receiver: Hmm…but my money is doing fine in CDs. caller: Mrs. Johnson, if I’m being honest with you, CDs suck and so do other kinds of mainstream investment options. These options will only give you crumbs while the companies benefit from your hard-earned money. If you really want to move up the social ladder, you have to seize a lifetime opportunity when it presents itself. receiver: I need more time to think about this. caller: We have a dedicated research department committed to serving our investors. I feel like I have already given you enough information to make the decision now. We are a highly reputed company, and we have offices across the U.S., Europe, and the Pacific Rim. The Securities and Exchange Commission ranked us as the most safe and high-yield investment return for the projected decade. And we have offices across the U.S., Europe, and the Pacific Rim. Can we work together on this now? receiver: I still don’t have enough info. caller: Ok. I’ll email you all the research from our team right after this. Mrs. Johnson, do you have the cash? receiver: Yeah, I do. But I need a guarantee in writing because this sounds like too good of an offer. caller: We’re a trustworthy company. With all that is going on right now, the banks are overwhelmed and at risk. And if I were you, Mrs. Johnson, I wouldn’t leave my money with them. So, how many units do you want to buy now? receiver: I don’t know… caller: This is only for today. If you invest $10,000, you’ll get $30,000 in six months. I’ll send a courier to your house at 3:00 pm today. I guarantee that this will be a good decision. Just have your check or cash ready, and I’ll take care of things for you. receiver: You sound like a good person. Thanks. I’ll have my check ready by then.",1

"caller: Hello, is this Mrs. Johnson? My name is Tim Thayer. I'm calling today to offer you an excellent opportunity. Do you have a minute to hear how you can make a lot of money in just a few short months? receiver: Well, I guess so. caller: I am with the International Mining Company, and for a limited time we are selling stock in high-yield gold and silver mines in southern Texas. We guarantee that for each $1,000 you invest you will receive a $3,000 return on your money in just six months. There is no risk of loss. How does that sound? receiver: I don't know enough about gold and silver mining to purchase stock. caller: I understand, Mrs. Johnson, and I appreciate your concern. However, you don’t need to know about the product in order to invest. For example, you probably don't know how to build a car—and neither do I—but that wouldn't keep us from investing in General Motors or Ford stock if we knew we would earn a lot of money. Doesn’t it make sense to look at the return on your investment and leave the mining to us, Mrs. Johnson? receiver: I don't know. My money is doing just fine in my CDs. caller: The truth is, Mrs. Johnson, CDs are scams. The same goes for other common investments like savings deposits, Treasury bills, municipals, and blue-chip stocks. Your money just earns a pitiful 1 to 6 percent a year and the rich will stay rich and the poor will stay poor. What I'm talking about is putting an end to that. This is your chance to get a real return on your money and invest in the future of technology. Probably the hardest thing to do, Mrs. Johnson, is to make a decision. This one is an easy decision to make: your money will triple in return value! receiver: I have to think this one over. caller: I have plenty of information to help you make an educated decision. If you are a serious investor, you can check everything out. Our company has offices throughout the United States, Europe, and the Pacific Rim, and we are reputable internationally for good management. As a matter of fact, the Securities and Exchange Commission recently listed our company as the #1 investment company in safety and yield over the next 10 years. So, can you make a decision to invest today? receiver: I’m still unsure, I need more information. caller: I’ll send all the information you request about our company and our highly trained mining engineers. We have a great deal of research reports on the mining stock market if you care to study them. And, by the way, Mrs. Johnson, do you have the cash at hand to take advantage of this amazing investment opportunity? receiver: Yes, I have the money and it sounds like a good investment. I'd love to get that kind of return on my money, but it just sounds too good to be true. Will you put the guarantee in writing? caller: There’s no need, this company is rock solid. You saw what happened to the economy recently. And now the banks are in trouble. I wouldn't entrust banks with my money these days. To be safe, I’d invest money in our company. How many units of stock are you prepared to buy today? receiver: Oh, I'm not sure. caller: Oh, I'm not sure. receiver: Let me think about it for a couple of days. I don’t want to rush into anything.  caller: Mrs. Johnson, this offer is only valid for today. The opportunity will be gone tomorrow. You're not a procrastinator, are you? This is too good an offer to pass up. A courier can be at your house by 3:00 today. Just have your check or cash for $10,000 ready. You won't regret investing with us. receiver: You sound honest, and the investment sounds good. But I still need to think about it. Thanks for the information. (hangs up).",1

I don’t know why. I mean out of all places around here? Is this cause of Mazda Miata, the convertible one? Or the reason is I didn’t pay it? caller: This is sir, because you filed taxes but your taxes have not been filed correctly for those years. There were problems regarding a W-2 and W-4 form.

He actually just fired somebody. I just gotta be careful. The last person he fired…I don’t even know the reason… but I am tying to speak to him to find out if I can persuade him…Ok wish me luck…I’m departing to be back in just a moment (Josh B then hangs up).",1

My money is doing fine in CDs. caller: The truth, Mrs. Johnson, is that CDs are for suckers. The same goes for savings deposits, Treasury bills, municipals, and blue-chip stocks.

Will you put the guarantee in writing? caller: This company is solid. Now the banks are in trouble. You saw what happened to the savings and loan industry.
